# Hate-Speech-Detection
This project uses TensorFlow to build a deep learning model for detecting hate speech in text. The model is trained on labeled data to accurately classify harmful language, leveraging TensorFlow's powerful tools for natural language processing (NLP) and text classification.


By utilizing TensorFlow's powerful capabilities for natural language processing (NLP), the project demonstrates an effective approach to identifying and mitigating hate speech, contributing to the broader effort of creating a safer online environment.
